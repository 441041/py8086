This is a _very_ downstripped 8086 emulator.
It has an interactive debugger and a disassembler.

Would be happy to hear if you do something fun with it :)

Note: the program "codegolf" was not made by me, it was made by "copy"
http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/users/3428/copy
See here: http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/4732/emulate-an-intel-8086-cpu

=== HOW-TO ===

Run (requires curses):

    python emu8086.py

Interactive debugger:
    
    python dbg.py

Output all states:
    
    python dbg.py a

=== TEST ===

Run unit tests:
    
    python emu8086_test.py

Run texttest:
    1    enter directory "texttest"
    2    start texttest (tested on version 3.22)
    3    in the left window under "texttest (e86)" select "RunProgram" (or "Disasm" to test the disasm output)
    4    press Run

This test runs the output of all states and compares the output with a known correct output.
This is a good integration test to make sure changes do not break the behavior.
For more info about texttest see: http://texttest.carmen.se/index.php?page=download
